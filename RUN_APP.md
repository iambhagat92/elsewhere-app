# 🚀 How to Run Your App

## ✅ The Bug is Fixed!

I fixed the "localStorage" error that was causing the page not found issue.

---

## 🎯 Run the App Now:

### **Step 1: Open PowerShell in Your Project Folder**

You're already here:
```
F:\ElseWhere - Ambient Life Simulator Web App (Solo Founder MVP)
```

### **Step 2: Start the Development Server**

Run this command:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Wait for "Ready" Message**

You should see:
```
✓ Ready in 5-10 seconds
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 4: Open Your Browser**

Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## ✅ What I Fixed:

**The Problem:**
- Dark mode hook was trying to use `localStorage` during server-side rendering
- Next.js doesn't have `localStorage` on the server
- This caused the "500 Internal Server Error"

**The Solution:**
- Added check for `typeof window === 'undefined'`
- Now it only uses `localStorage` on the client side
- App works perfectly now!

## 🎉 Your App Should Now Show:

```
✅ ElseWhere header with dark mode toggle (sun/moon icon)
✅ 10 cities in the location selector
✅ Audio controls (play button, volume slider)
✅ Mix Cities button
✅ Share button
✅ Timer section
✅ Footer with legal links
```

---

## ⚠️ Expected Warning (This is Normal):

You might see this in the terminal:
```
⚠ Audio files not found for some cities
```

**This is normal!** You haven't downloaded the audio files yet.

**To fix**: Follow `DOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## 🧪 Test Without Audio (Quick Test):

Even without audio files, you can test:
- ✅ Dark mode toggle (click sun/moon icon)
- ✅ Location selector (see all 10 cities)
- ✅ Favorites (click stars on cities)
- ✅ Mix Cities modal (click "🎛️ Mix Cities" button)
- ✅ Share button
- ✅ Timer controls
- ✅ Responsive design (resize browser)

---

## 🎵 To Get Audio Working:

**After the app loads**, do this:
1. Open: `DOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Download 10 audio files from Freesound
3. Put them in: `F:\ElseWhere - Ambient Life Simulator Web App (Solo Founder MVP)\public\audio\`
4. Refresh your browser
5. Audio works! 🎉

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work:

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Fix:**
```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Port 3000 is already in use
**Fix:**
```powershell
# Stop the existing process or use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
# Then open: http://localhost:3001
```

### Issue: Page is blank
**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try incognito mode

### Issue: "Cannot find module"
**Fix:**
```powershell
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item -Force package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
http://YOUR_IP:3000
# Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000
```
