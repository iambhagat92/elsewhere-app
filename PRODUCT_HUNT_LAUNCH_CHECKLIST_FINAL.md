### **First Comment Template**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Ashok (solo founder), and I'm thrilled to share ElseWhere with you today!

🌍 **What is ElseWhere?**

ElseWhere transports you to 30 cities around the world with authentic ambient sounds. It's like working from a Tokyo cafe, studying in a Paris bistro, or relaxing on Copacabana beach - without leaving your desk.

---

🎵 **Features:**

• **30 Unique Cities:** Tokyo, Paris, NYC, London, Mumbai, Bangkok, Rome, Barcelona, Istanbul, Moscow, Sydney, Rio, Cairo, Berlin, Dubai, Seoul, and 14 more

• **Mix & Match:** Layer multiple cities simultaneously with independent volume controls - create your perfect soundscape

• **Dark/Light Mode:** Easy on the eyes, day or night

• **Favorites System:** Star your go-to cities for quick access

• **Audio Visualizer:** Animated feedback so you know it's playing

• **Timer:** Built-in Pomodoro timer for focused work sessions

• **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Control everything without touching your mouse

• **Zero Friction:** Works instantly - no signup, no ads, completely free forever

• **Mobile-Friendly:** Fully responsive on any device

---

💡 **Why I Built This:**

As a remote worker, I struggled with focus. Music was too distracting, silence made my mind wander, and existing ambient sound tools were either:
- Behind paywalls ($5-10/month)
- Full of intrusive ads
- Limited to 3-5 sounds
- Complicated to use

So I built what I actually wanted to use - simple, free, with tons of variety.

---

🛠️ **Tech Stack (for the curious):**

• Built with Next.js 14, React 18, and Tailwind CSS
• ~350MB of Creative Commons licensed audio from Freesound.org
• Fully responsive design
• localStorage for preferences
• Web Audio API for mixing
• Hosted on Render

---

🎯 **Use Cases:**

• **Deep Work:** Mix Tokyo (70%) + Seoul (30%) for busy cafe vibes
• **Study Sessions:** Paris (80%) + Berlin (20%) for calm atmosphere  
• **Relaxation:** Sydney (60%) + Rio (40%) for beach serenity
• **ADHD Focus:** New York (100%) for consistent background noise
• **Meditation:** Mumbai (50%) + Bangkok (50%) for spiritual calm

---

🙏 **I'd Love Your Feedback:**

• Which cities would you like to see added next?
• What features would make this more useful for you?
• How do you currently use ambient sounds in your workflow?
• Any bugs or issues? (I'll fix them ASAP!)

No signup, no payment, no BS. Just ambient sounds. 🌍✨

Thanks so much for checking it out! Your support means the world to me.

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No one is upvoting!"
- **Solution:** It's normal to start slow. Keep engaging, share more, be patient. Traffic builds over the 24 hours.

### "Negative comments!"
- **Solution:** Thank them for feedback, ask for specifics, offer to improve. Stay positive - criticism helps you grow.

### "Website is down!"
- **Solution:** Check Render dashboard, look at error logs, have a status page ready, communicate openly about fixes.

### "Stuck at #15-25!"
- **Solution:** Keep engaging with comments (increases ranking), post milestone updates, share on more channels, upvote quality > quantity.

### "Someone is copying my product!"
- **Solution:** Focus on your launch, competition validates your idea, yours is already live and has first-mover advantage.
