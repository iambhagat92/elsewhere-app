## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (Post immediately after launch)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Bhagat, and I'm excited to share ElseWhere with you today!

🌍 **What is ElseWhere?**

ElseWhere transports you to 30 cities around the world with authentic ambient sounds. It's like working from a Tokyo cafe, studying in a Paris bistro, or relaxing on Copacabana beach - without leaving your desk.

---

🎵 **Features:**

• **30 Unique Cities:** Tokyo, Paris, NYC, London, Mumbai, Bangkok, Rome, Barcelona, Istanbul, Moscow, Sydney, Rio, Cairo, and 17 more

• **Mix & Match:** Combine multiple cities for unique soundscapes

• **Customizable:** Volume controls, dark/light mode

• **Zero Friction:** Works instantly - no signup, no ads, completely free

• **Mobile-Friendly:** Use it anywhere, on any device

---

💡 **Why I Built This:**

I work from home and struggled with focus. Music was too distracting, silence made my mind wander, and existing ambient sound tools were either:
- Behind paywalls
- Full of ads
- Limited to 2-3 sounds
- Complicated to use

So I built what I actually wanted to use - simple, free, with tons of variety.

---

🛠️ **Tech Details (for the curious):**

• Built with Next.js 14, React, and Tailwind CSS
• ~350MB of Creative Commons audio from Freesound.org
• Hosted on Render's free tier
• Fully open to feedback and improvements!

---

🙏 **I'd Love Your Feedback:**

• What cities would you like to see added?
• What features would make this more useful?
• How do you use ambient sounds in your workflow?
