## 🎭 Why This Distribution Works:

### **1. Geographic Clustering**
Cities from same regions share similar vibes:
- European cities → European sounds
- Asian megacities → Asian urban sounds
- Beach cities → Ocean/relaxed sounds
- Middle Eastern → Desert/market sounds

### **2. Cultural Similarity**
Matched sounds to cultural atmospheres:
- Café culture cities → Paris sound
- Dense urban → NYC sound
- Tropical → Sydney/Singapore sound
- Historic → London/Berlin sound

### **3. Maximum Variety in Mixes**
When users mix cities, they get diverse sounds:
- Tokyo + Paris + NYC = 3 different sounds
- Moscow + Istanbul + Bangkok = 3 different sounds

### **4. No Adjacent Duplicates**
In the location list, similar-sounding cities are spread out so users don't notice patterns.
