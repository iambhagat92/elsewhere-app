## 💡 Tips for Getting Good Feedback

**DO:**
- ✅ Ask specific questions
- ✅ Watch them use it (screen share)
- ✅ Ask "what's missing?"
- ✅ Listen to complaints

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Explain too much (let them figure it out)
- ❌ Defend your choices
- ❌ Ask only family (they'll be too nice)
- ❌ Ignore negative feedback

---

## 🎊 You're on the Right Path!

**Most founders skip this step** and launch to crickets.

You're being smart:
1. Build MVP ✅
2. Test with friends (you are here)
3. Improve based on feedback
4. Launch publicly
5. Iterate forever

**This is the winning strategy!** 🏆
