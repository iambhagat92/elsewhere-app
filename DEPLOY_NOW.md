## 📱 Important Notes

### **Audio File Warning**:
Your audio files are 60-80 MB each. First load will take time on slower connections. This is normal!

**Optimization tips** (for future):
- Use a CDN for audio files
- Add loading progress bar
- Compress audio to 128 kbps

### **Custom Domain** (Optional):
If you want `elsewhere.app` instead of `your-project.vercel.app`:
1. Buy domain at Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
2. Go to Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains
3. Add your domain
4. Follow Vercel's DNS instructions
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for SSL

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Audio doesn't play on deployed site"
**Solution**: Audio files might not be in Git
```powershell
# Check if audio files are tracked
git ls-files public/audio/

# If empty, they weren't committed. Add them:
git add public/audio/*.mp3 -f
git commit -m "Add audio files"
git push
```

### "Vercel build failed"
**Common causes**:
- Missing dependencies → Run `npm install` locally first
- Syntax errors → Check console for errors
- Missing files → Make sure all imports exist

**Solution**: Check Vercel build logs for specific error

### "Changes not showing"
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check Vercel deployment status
3. Trigger manual redeploy in Vercel dashboard

---

## 📊 Monitor Your App

### Vercel Dashboard:
- View deployment history
- Check error logs
- See visitor analytics (if enabled)
- Monitor build times

### Google Analytics (Optional):
1. Create account at analytics.google.com
2. Get tracking ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Add to your app (see CUSTOMIZE_YOUR_APP.md)

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Visitors**: How many people visit
- **Time on site**: Average session length
