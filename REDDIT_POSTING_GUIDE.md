Hey r/productivity!

I struggle with focus, especially working from home. Music is too distracting, silence is too boring.

What makes it useful for productivity:
✓ Masks distracting noises
✓ Not music, so doesn't interfere with thinking
✓ Creates "working in a cafe" vibe
✓ Mix multiple cities for variety
✓ No ads or interruptions

Cities: Tokyo, Paris, NYC, London, Mumbai, Bangkok, Rome, Barcelona, and 22 more.
