## 🤔 GRAY AREAS (Be Careful!)

### Asking for Support
✅ **OK:** "Hey [Name], I'm launching on PH today. Would love your feedback if you have time!"  
❌ **NOT OK:** "Please upvote my product on Product Hunt" (generic mass message)

✅ **OK:** Share your launch on Twitter/LinkedIn naturally  
❌ **NOT OK:** "Click this link and upvote now!" (demanding)

### Community Sharing
✅ **OK:** Post in relevant Slack/Discord where it genuinely helps  
❌ **NOT OK:** Spam your link in 50 unrelated communities

### Competitive Posting
✅ **OK:** Launch alongside competitors (happens often!)  
❌ **NOT OK:** Downvote competitors or leave negative comments
