## 🔍 Where to Find Audio

### **Option 1: Freesound.org** (Best Quality)
1. Search for "[city name] ambient sounds"
2. Examples:
   - "london street ambient"
   - "berlin cafe sounds"
   - "dubai city ambience"
   - "mumbai market sounds"
   - "seoul urban ambient"

### **Option 2: Pixabay** (No Account Needed)
- https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/ambient/
- Download generic ambient sounds and rename

### **Option 3: YouTube to MP3**
Search YouTube for:
- "London ambient sounds 1 hour"
- "Berlin street sounds"
- "Dubai city ambience"
- "Mumbai traffic ambient"
- "Seoul city sounds"

Then use a converter like ytmp3.nu

## ⚠️ What Happens If You Don't Add Audio?

The new cities will:
- ✅ Show up in the location list
- ✅ Display correct time
- ✅ Be selectable
- ❌ BUT won't play audio (will show error)

**Solution**: Either add the audio files OR remove those cities from the app.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Testing)

**Option A: Use Existing Audio**
Copy your existing files and rename them temporarily:

```powershell
# In this folder, run:
Copy-Item tokyo-ambient.mp3 -Destination london-ambient.mp3
Copy-Item paris-ambient.mp3 -Destination berlin-ambient.mp3
Copy-Item newyork-ambient.mp3 -Destination dubai-ambient.mp3
Copy-Item rio-ambient.mp3 -Destination mumbai-ambient.mp3
Copy-Item sydney-ambient.mp3 -Destination seoul-ambient.mp3
```

This lets you test the features immediately!
Replace with real city audio later.

---

**Option B: Remove New Cities (Temporary)**
If you don't want to deal with audio yet, I can temporarily remove the 5 new cities from the app.

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**For now**: Use Option A (copy existing files) so you can:
- Test all new features
- Show friends the full app
- Get feedback on which cities they want most

**Later**: Add real audio based on:
- Which cities are most popular
- User requests
- Your personal preference

---

**The app will work either way!** 🎉
