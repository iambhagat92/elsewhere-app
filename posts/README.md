## üìù How to Add New Blog Posts

### 1. Create a New Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in this `posts/` directory.

**File naming:** Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `tokyo-cafe-sounds-guide.md`)

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Every blog post must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml

description: "A compelling 155-character description with keywords"
date: "2025-10-05"
author: "ElseWhere Team"
category: "Productivity"
tags: ["ambient sounds", "focus", "productivity"]
image: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
slug: "your-blog-post-slug"
---
```

### 3. Write Your Content

Write your blog post in Markdown format below the frontmatter.

**Example:**

```markdown
# Main Title

Your introduction paragraph here...

## Section 1

Content for section 1...

### Subsection

More details...

## Section 2

More content...
```

### 4. Internal Linking (IMPORTANT for SEO!)

Always link to:
- Other blog posts: `[link text](/blog/other-post-slug)`
- Your app: `[Try ElseWhere](/)`
- Homepage: `[ElseWhere](https://elsewhere-app.onrender.com)`

**Example:**
