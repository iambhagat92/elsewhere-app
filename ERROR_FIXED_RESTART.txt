========================================
   ✅ ERROR FIXED! RESTART SERVER
========================================

I fixed the hydration error!

The problem was: Some components were trying to use
browser features (localStorage, Audio) during 
server-side rendering.

The solution: Wrapped them with NoSSR component
so they only render on the client side.

========================================

DO THIS NOW:

1. CLOSE the black window (START_SERVER.bat)
   - Just click the X or type Ctrl+C

2. WAIT 5 seconds

3. Double-click START_SERVER.bat again

4. WAIT for "Ready" message (10 seconds)

5. Double-click OPEN_APP.html

6. The error should be GONE! ✅

========================================

The app should now load perfectly without
the "Unhandled Runtime Error" message!
