## 📋 STEP 3: Verify Ownership

Google will show you **5 verification methods**. Use Method 1 (easiest):

### **Method 1: HTML File Upload** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

1. Google will give you a file to download (like `google1234567890abcdef.html`)
2. **Download this file**
3. **Upload it to your project:**
   - Save it in: `F:\ElseWhere - Ambient Life Simulator Web App (Solo Founder MVP)\public\`
   - The file should be at: `public/google1234567890abcdef.html`

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```powershell
   cd "F:\ElseWhere - Ambient Life Simulator Web App (Solo Founder MVP)"
   git add public/google*.html
   git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification file"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Render to deploy
6. **Verify it's accessible:**
   - Open: `https://elsewhere-app.onrender.com/google1234567890abcdef.html`
   - Should show: `google-site-verification: google1234567890abcdef.html`

7. **Go back to Google Search Console** and click **"Verify"**

✅ **Success!** You'll see "Ownership verified"

### **Alternative: HTML Tag Method** (If file method doesn't work)

1. Google gives you a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="ABC123XYZ..." />
   ```

2. **Tell me the verification code** and I'll add it to your site!
3. Commit, push, wait 2 minutes
4. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

## 📋 STEP 4: Submit Sitemap

Once verified:

1. In Google Search Console, look for **"Sitemaps"** in left sidebar

3. In the "Add a new sitemap" field, enter: `sitemap.xml`
4. Click **"Submit"**

✅ Google will start crawling your pages!

**Expected message:** "Sitemap submitted successfully"

## 📋 STEP 5: Request Indexing (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Search Console, go to **"URL Inspection"** (top bar)
2. Enter: `https://elsewhere-app.onrender.com`
3. Click search icon
4. You'll see "URL is not on Google" (normal for new sites)
